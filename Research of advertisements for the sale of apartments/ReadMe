### Research of advertisements for the sale of apartments
Sale of apartments in St. Petersburg - analysis of the real estate market


We need to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

### Skills:
Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, math, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing


### Conclusions
- In this project, we have chosen the boundaries for the parameters when submitting an advertisement for the sale of apartments. Why is this needed? In order to filter out ads that are clearly untrue at the beginning (ceiling height 100 m or apartment area 2 meters, etc.)
- We analyzed the dependence of prices on various factors
